# Cytosine-Deamination-Patterns-in-aDNA-Libraries

Scripts to obtain cytosine deamination damage patterns from human ancient DNA libraries in bash from single fastq files, and produce customised plots in R Studios.

Files
- aDNA Damage Pattern Pipeline [bash]: used to assess the aDNA characteristics of DNA libraries available online (from fastq file).
- Human Reference Genome Download and Indexing [bash]: used to download and index the human reference genome necessary in the primary pipeline.
- Cytosine Deamination Plot script [R]: used to create customised plots from the damage pattern data of dsDNA or ssDNA libraries produced in the primary pipeline.
