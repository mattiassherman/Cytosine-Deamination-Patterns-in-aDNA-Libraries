# Cytosine-Deamination-Patterns-in-aDNA-Libraries

This is code to obtain cytosine deamination damage patterns from human ancient DNA libraries in bash from single fastq files and produce customised plots in R Studios.

The first associated bash script (aDNA Damage Pattern Pipeline) was used to assess the aDNA characteristics of multiple libraries available online. The second bash script (Human Reference Genome Download and Indexing) was used to index the human reference genome necessary in the primary pipeline. The following file, an R script (aDNA Misincorporation Plot Script), allows for the creation of customised plots from the damage pattern data of dsDNA or ssDNA libraries produced in the primary pipeline.
